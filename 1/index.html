<h1>Hi, my name is Peachy</h1>
<img src="IMG_0891.jpg" alt="Peachy headshot"> 
<p>My passion is to <i>create, write</i>, and <i>empower</i>.
<br><b>A young heart, old soul.</b></p>
<I>Here are a few things about me:</I>
<ul>
    <li>I love having coffee over meaningful conversation, and if you haven't I recommend you check out <b>Cafe Mak</b> right by Shatto Place.
        <br>The ambiance there is really good. I'm sure you'll love it!</br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <li>I love to create. Pottery and polymer clay are my favorite mediums. 
            <br>Mostly self-taught crafter using polymer clays but took my pottery lessons in Sagada, Philippines. 
            <br><br><img width="500px" src="Pottery.jpg" alt="Peach in Sagada"></li>
            <br>
        <li>I've been to several countries but my most favorite and wouldn't mind living in would be the country Taiwan. 
            <br>If you go visit Taiwan make sure to explore their street foods in Night Markets. Definitely for the win!
